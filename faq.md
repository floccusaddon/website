# Which browsers are supported by floccus?
Currently floccus supports Chromium, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi and Microsoft Edge.

# How can I access my bookmarks on my phone?
The only mobile browser to support extensions that interact with bookmarks is currently the free Kiwi browser.

Alternatively, if you're syncing via Nextcloud bookmarks, you may use one of its companion mobile apps.

# Does floccus support bookmarks tags in Firefox?
Unfortunately not, Mozilla has not yet added an API for interacting with native tags. However, floccus will not touch your tags.

# Does floccus track usage data at all?
No. Floccus does not track you in any way. The only network traffic initiated by floccus is syncing your bookmarks to the server of your choosing. That's it.

# I am currently using a different tool to sync my browser data. Can I use this with floccus?
No, any other sync tool affecting your browser bookmarks will lead to duplication and possibly corrupt data. Please disable any active browser syncing tool before using floccus.
